Reason for using realm:

Realm’s object-oriented data model doesn’t need an ORM, and lets you write less code.
Realm’s local database persists data on-disk, so apps work as well offline as they do online.
Realm is fully-featured, lightweight, and efficiently uses memory, disk space, and battery life.
